## API 
The movie database API v3:  

https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction

## Tech stack 
- iOS 16 target 
- UIKit + SDWebImage + CoreData + Lottie (in future) All UI in code
- MVP architecture, because MVC is kinda sus
- moduled system for all parts of programm 
- Delegate pattern usage
## Coming Soon
- Autorization (via api provided tools, or hopefuly FireBase)
- Animations, because who does not like them(espectially when you hide poor api responce time with them)
- UI improvenets
- Code improvements. Because I believe in perfection, and it's a very long journey to acheive it
- Feature to watch movie trailers in app, using YouTube API
